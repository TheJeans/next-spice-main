# my notes :D

## initial read through the `README.md` file
- [ ] Set Up Basic Home Page:
    - [ ] Create a simple home page with minimal styling.
    - [ ] Ensure the home page is SEO-friendly for Google indexing.
        - ðŸ’¬ if the focus is on SEO, SSR would be good.
- [ ] Develop Lists with Links:
    - [ ] Make a list of spices.
    - [ ] Make a list of blends.
    - [ ] Add functionality to search and filter these lists.
- [ ] Detail Pages (Lists should:)
    - [ ] link to the detail pages for an individual spice (started)
    - [ ] link to the individual blend (bonus, you'll have to extend the API)
        - ðŸ’¬ this does say bonus so I'm just going to assume this isn't a priority and have this done last maybe?
- [ ] Showcase Front-End Skills:
    - [ ] Add a feature, refactor existing code, or demonstrate excellent styling to showcase your strengths as a Front-End developer.
        - ðŸ’¬ Cool, I'm thinking of a sick design or something. I'll experiment more later. Functionality first!

## Important notes from `README.md`
- **Do not attempt to speed up API calls**. leave setTimeouts in the API file as they are.
    - **You can write your own API endpoint**, again just don't mess with the base API endpoints and timeouts
- **Keep SEO and performance considerations in mind**, as they are key interests for Tomo.
- **Utilize TypeScript**
- **Use whatever resources** *but be prepared to talk about them*.
